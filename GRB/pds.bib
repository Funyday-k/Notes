  abstract = {We apply Fourier analysis to 214 light curves of long gamma-ray bursts and study the statistical properties of their power density spectra (PDSs). The averaged PDS is found to follow a power law of index -5/3 over almost 2 decades of frequency with a break at about 2 Hz. Individual PDSs are exponentially distributed around the power law. It provides evidence that the diversity of the bursts is due to random realizations of the same process which is self-similar over the full range of time-scales. The -5/3 slope of the average spectrum may indicate that gamma-ray bursts are related to a phenomenon well studied in hydrodynamics - fully developed turbulence.},

    abstract = "{We review some practical aspects of measuring the amplitude of variability in ‘red noise’ light curves typical of those from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in AGN light curves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, Fvar, and excess variance, σ2XS, are examined. Their statistical properties, relationship to the power spectrum and uses for investigating the nature of the variability processes are discussed. We demonstrate that σ2XS (or similarly Fvar) shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the variability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of these estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between different sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. Some examples of the expected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical power spectral shapes, based on Monte Carlo simulations. The excess variance can be useful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different energy bands from the same observation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to derive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected between different energy bands (due to measurement errors). Finally, these estimators are used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 766. The source is found to show a strong, linear correlation between rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.}",

ABSTRACT = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are some of the most energetic events in the Universe and are potential sites of cosmic ray acceleration up to the highest energies. GRBs have therefore been a target of interest for very high energy gamma-ray observatories for many years, leading to the recent discovery of a number of bursts with photons reaching energies above 100 GeV. We summarize the GRB observational campaigns of the current generation of very high energy gamma-ray observatories as well as describing the observations and properties of the GRBs discovered so far. We compare the properties of the very high energy bursts to the total GRB distribution and make predictions for the next generation of very high energy gamma-ray observations.},

	abstract = {We consider the evidence for very hard low energy spectra during the prompt phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). In particular we examine the spectral evolution of GRB 980306 together with the detailed analysis of some other bursts already presented in the literature (GRB 911118, GRB 910807, GRB 910927 and GRB 970111), and check for the significance of their hardness (i.e. extremely steep spectral slopes below the \$EF\_\{E\}\$ peak) by applying different tests. These bursts, detected by the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) in the \${\textbackslash}sim 30\$ keV -- 2 MeV energy range, are sufficiently bright to allow time resolved spectral studies on time intervals of the order of tenths of a second. We discuss the hard spectra of these bursts and their evolution in the context of several non--thermal emission models, which all appear inadequate to account for these cases. The extremely hard spectra, which are detected in the early part of the BATSE light curve, are also compared with a black body spectral model: the resulting fits are remarkably good, except for an excess at high energies (in several cases) which could be simply accounted for by the presence of a supra--thermal component. The findings on the possible thermal character of the evolving spectrum and the implications on the GRB physical scenario are considered in the frameworks of photospheric models for a fireball which is becoming optically thin, and of Compton drag models, in which the fireball boosts ambient seed photons by its own bulk motion. Both models, according to simple estimates, appear to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the found spectral characteristics, although their possible caveats are discussed.},

	abstract = {The origin of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission still defies explanation, in spite of recent progress made, for example, on the occasional presence of a thermal component in the spectrum along with the ubiquitous non-thermal component that is modelled with a Band function. The combination of finite duration and aperiodic modulations make GRBs hard to characterise temporally. Although correlations between GRB luminosity and spectral hardness on one side and time variability on the other side have long been known, the loose and often arbitrary definition of the latter makes the interpretation uncertain. We characterise the temporal variability in an objective way and search for a connection with rest-frame spectral properties for a number of well-observed GRBs. We studied the individual power density spectra (PDS) of 123 long gamma-ray bursts with measured redshift, rest-frame peak energy Ep,i of the time-averaged nuFnu spectrum, and well-constrained PDS slope alpha detected with Swift, Fermi and past spacecraft. The PDS were modelled with a power law either with or without a break adopting a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. We find a highly significant Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation. The null hypothesis probability is {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}-9. In the framework of the internal shock synchrotron model, the Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation can hardly be reconciled with the predicted Ep,i propto Gamma{\textasciicircum}-2, unless either variable microphysical parameters of the shocks or continual electron acceleration are assumed. Alternatively, in the context of models based on magnetic reconnection, the PDS slope and Ep,i are linked to the ejecta magnetisation at the dissipation site, so that more magnetised outflows would produce more variable GRB light curves at short timescales ({\textless}= 1 s), shallower PDS, and higher values of Ep,i.},
