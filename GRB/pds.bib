  abstract = {We apply Fourier analysis to 214 light curves of long gamma-ray bursts and study the statistical properties of their power density spectra (PDSs). The averaged PDS is found to follow a power law of index -5/3 over almost 2 decades of frequency with a break at about 2 Hz. Individual PDSs are exponentially distributed around the power law. It provides evidence that the diversity of the bursts is due to random realizations of the same process which is self-similar over the full range of time-scales. The -5/3 slope of the average spectrum may indicate that gamma-ray bursts are related to a phenomenon well studied in hydrodynamics - fully developed turbulence.},

  abstract = {Timing analysis is a powerful tool with which to shed light on the still obscure emission physics and geometry of the prompt emission of GRBs. Fourier power density spectra (PDS) characterise time series as stochastic processes and can be used to search for coherent pulsations and to investigate the dominant variability timescales. Because of the limited duration and of the statistical properties, modelling the PDS of individual GRBs is challenging, and only average PDS of large samples have been discussed in the literature. We characterise the individual PDS of GRBs in terms of a stochastic process, and carry out for the first time a systematic search for periodic signals and for a link between the PDS and other observables. We present a Bayesian procedure that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and apply it to study 215 bright long GRBs detected with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope from January 2005 to May 2015. The PDS are modelled with a power-law either with or without a break. Two classes of GRBs emerge: with or without a unique dominant timescale. A comparison with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveals similar distributions of PDS slopes. Unexpectedly, GRBs with subsecond-dominant timescales and duration longer than a few tens of seconds in the source frame appear to be either very rare or altogether absent. Three GRBs are found with possible evidence for a periodic signal at {\textasciitilde}3 sigma (Gaussian) significance, corresponding to a multitrial chance probability of {\textasciitilde}1\%. Thus, we found no compelling evidence for periodic signals. The analogy between the PDS of GRBs and of AGNs could tentatively indicate similar stochastic processes that rule BH accretion across different BH mass scales and objects. In addition, we find evidence that short dominant timescales and duration are not completely independent of each other, in contrast with commonly accepted paradigms (abridged).},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The study of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and power density spectra (PDSs) continuum properties can help shed light on the still elusive emission physics of magnetars and as a window into the interiors of neutron stars using asteroseismology. In this work, we employ a PDS method to search for the QPOs in the hundreds of X-ray bursts from SGR J1935+2154 observed by Insight-HXMT, GECAM, and Fermi/GBM from 2014 July to 2022 January. Although no definitive QPO signal (significance \&gt;3\,{$\sigma$}) is detected in individual bursts or the averaged periodogram of the bursts grouped by duration, we identify several bursts exhibiting features at {$\sim$}40~Hz, attributed to the the proximity intervals between adjacent pulses and consistent with that reported in the X-ray burst associated with FRB 200428. We investigate the PDS continuum properties and find that the distribution of the PDS slope in the simple power-law model peaks at {$\sim$}2.5, which is consistent with other magnetars but higher than 5/3 commonly seen in gamma-ray bursts. Besides, the distribution of the break frequency in the broken power-law model peaks at {$\sim$}60~Hz. Finally, we report that the power-law index of PDS has an anti-correlation and power-law dependence on the burst duration as well as the minimum variation time-scale.},
