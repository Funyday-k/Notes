## 1.6 Heat Capacities 热容

### 1.6.1 热容

The **Heat capacity** of an object is the amount of heat needed to raise its temperature, per degree temperature increase:

$$
C\equiv \underset{\varDelta T\rightarrow 0}{\lim}\frac{\varDelta Q}{\varDelta T}
$$

A more fundamental quantity is the **special heat capacity(比热容)**, defined as the heat capacity per unit mass:

$$
c\equiv \frac{C}{m}
$$

 So the heat capacity, for the particular case where $W=0$ and $V$ is constant, is called the **heat capacity at constant volume(定体热容),** denoted $C_V$.

$$
C_V=\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right) _V
$$

If the *pressure* surrounding your object happens to be constant, then the total heat needed is unambigous, and we refer to the heat needed per degree as $C_P$, the **heat capacity at constant pressure.** So we have 

$$
C_P=\left( \frac{\varDelta U-\left( -P\varDelta V \right)}{\varDelta T} \right) _P=\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right) _P+P\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right) _P
$$

Suppose that our system stores thermal energy only in quadratic “degrees of freedom.” Then the equipartition theorem says $U=\frac{1}{2}NfkT$,so

 

$$
C_V=\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}=\frac{Nfk}{2}
$$

assuming that $f$ is independent of temperature.

For a solid, there are six degrees per atom, so the heat capacity per mole should be $\frac{6}{2}R=3R$; this general result is called the **rule of Dulong and Petit**. 

As for the ideal gas, the derivative $\partial U/\partial T$ is the same with $P$ fixed as with $V$fixed, and we can compute the second term. At constant pressure,

$$
\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right) _P=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left( \frac{NkT}{P} \right) =\frac{Nk}{T}
$$

Therefore,

$$
C_P=C_V+Nk=C_V+nR
$$

### 1.6.2 潜热(Latent Heat )

In some situations you can put heat into a system without increasing its temperature at *all.* This normally happens at a **phase transformation**, such as melting ice or boiling water. Technocally, the heat capacity is thrn *infinite:*

$$
C=\frac{Q}{\varDelta T}=\frac{Q}{0}=\infty 
$$

For this amount $Q$, divided by the mass of the substance, is called the **latent heat** of the transformation, and denoted $L$:

$$
L\equiv \frac{Q}{m}
$$
