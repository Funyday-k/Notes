### 1.7.2 粘滞（Viscosity）

<aside>
❗ Energy isn’t the only thing that can spread through a fluid at the molecular level; another is *momentum.*

</aside>

We consider the following flow scenarios. The motion is slow enough, or the gap is narrow enough, that the flow of the fluid is entirely horizontal. Then the flow is said to be **laminar(层流).**

With only a few exceptions at very low temperatures, all fluids tend to resist this kind of shearing, differential flow. This resistance is called **viscosity(粘滞)**

We can obtain that the force is proportional to the common area of the surfaces, inversely proportional to the width of the gap, and directly proportional to the diffrence in velocity between the two surfaces

$$
\frac{F_x}{A}\propto \frac{\varDelta u_x}{\varDelta z}
$$

The constant of proportionality is called the **coeffcient of viscosity(粘滞系数)；**the standard symbol for this coeffcient is $\eta$ . Our formula for the force is then 

$$
\frac{\left| F_x \right|}{A}=\eta \frac{du_x}{dz}
$$

The correct term for such a force per unit area is **shear stress(剪切应力)**.

### 1.7.3 扩散过程（Diffusion）

<aside>
❗ Heat conduction is the transport of *energy* by random thermal motions. Viscosity results from the transport of *moentum*, which in gases is accomplished mainly by **random thermal motions.**

</aside>

The **flux** of these particles across any surface is the net number that cross it per unit area per unit time; the symbol for particle flux is $\vec{J}$.

Using the symbol $D$ for the constant of proportionality, we can write

$$
J_x=-D\frac{dn}{dx}
$$

The minus sign indicates that if $dn/dx$ is positive, the flux is in the negative $x$ direction. This equation is known as **Fick’s law.**

The constant $D$ is called the **diffusion coefficient(扩散系数);** it depends both on the type of molecule that is diffusing and on what it is diffusing through.

By considering the flux of these particles from both directions into a short segment $\Delta x$, dereive **Fick’s second law.** 

$$
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial ^2n}{\partial x^2}
$$
