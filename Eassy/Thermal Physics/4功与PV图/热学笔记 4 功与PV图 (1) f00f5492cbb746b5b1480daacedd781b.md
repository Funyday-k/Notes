## 1.5 Compression Work(压缩功)

### 1.5.1 功的表达式

For a gas, the force is parallel to the displacement, so we can just write 

$W=F\Delta x$

Then we replace $F$ by $PA$, the pressure of the gas times the area of the piston. But the whole compression process must be **quasistatic(准静态)**

For quasistatic compression, the work is 

$$
W=-P\Delta V \  \ (quasistatic)
$$

### 1.5.2 功在PV图下的意义

Usually the pressure will *change* during the compression. And this procedure is easier to understand graphically.

If you happen to know a formula for the pressure as a function of volume, $P(V)$, then you can compute the total work as an integral:

$$
W=-\int\limits_{V_i}^{V_f}{P\left( V \right) dV}
$$

### 1.5.3 理想气体的压缩

In this section we’ll consider two idealized ways of compressiong an ideal gas:

1. **Isothermal compression(等温压缩)，**which is so slow that the temperature of the gas doesn’t rise at all.
2. **Adiabatic compression(绝热压缩),** which is so fast that no heat escapes from the gas during the process.

In the case of isothermal compression, on a PV disgram, the formula $P=NkT/V$, for constant $T$, is a concave-up hyperbola(凹上双曲线) called an **isotherm(等温线).** 

The work done is minus the area under the graph:

 

$$
W=-\int_{V_i}^{V_f}{PdV=-NkT\int_{V_i}^{V_f}{\frac{1}{V}dV=}NkT\ln \frac{V_i}{V_f}}
$$

We can use the first law of thermodynamics and the fact that for an ideal gas $U$is proportional to $T$. Thus the heat **input** is just **minus** the work done.

$$
Q=\varDelta U-W=0-W=NkT\ln \frac{V_f}{V_i}
$$

If you do work on a gas but don’t let any heat escape, the internal energy of the gas will increase

$$
\Delta U=Q+U=W
$$

Following the same treatment, we can get the relation that the adiabatic process obeys

$$
V^\gamma P=constant
$$

where $\gamma$, called the **adiabatic exponent**, is an abbreviation for $(f+2)/f$
