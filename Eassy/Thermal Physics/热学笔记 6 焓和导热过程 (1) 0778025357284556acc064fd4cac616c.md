# 热学笔记 6 焓和导热过程 (1)

### 1.6.3 焓

Adding $PV$ onto the energy gives a quantity called the **enthalpy**, denoted $H$:

$$
H\equiv U+PV
$$

<aside>
❗ This is the *total* energy you would have to come up with, to create the system out of nothing and put it into this envirenment. Or, put another way, if you could somehow annihilate the system, the energy you could extract is not just $U$, but also the work ($PV$) done by the atmosphere as it collapses to fill the vaccum.

</aside>

The change in enthalpy during a constant-pressure process is 

$$
\Delta H=\Delta U+P\Delta V
$$

Combining the first law of thermodynamics, we obtain 

$$
\Delta H=Q+W_{other}
$$

the change in enthalpy is caused *only* by heat and other forms of work, not by compression-expansion work.

For the simple case of raising an object’s temperature, the change in enthalpy  per degree, at constant pressure, is the same as the heat capacity at constant pressure,$C_P$:

$$
C_P=\left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial T} \right) _P
$$

### 1.7.1 热传导（Heat Conduction）

We can write  **heat conduction equation**

$$
\frac{Q}{\Delta t}=-k_tA\frac{dT}{dx}
$$

The constant of proportionality depends on the material through which the heat is being conducted. This constant is called the **thermal conductivity** of the material. To distuiguish from Boltzmann’s constant we’ll call is $k_t$. This equation is known as the **Fourier heat conduction law**.

By considering the heat flowing from both directions into a small segment of length $\Delta x$ , derive the **heat equation,**

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=K\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $K=k_t/c\rho$, $c$ is the specific heat of the material, and $\rho$  is its density.

### 1.7.2 Conductivity of an Ideal Gas

The average distance teaveled between collisions(碰撞) is called the **mean free path(平均自由程)**. 

The mean free path, $\ell$ , is roughly the length of the cylinder when this condition is met:

$$
\text{volume of cylinder=average volume per molecule}\\ \begin{align*}\Rightarrow \pi \left( 2r \right) ^2\ell &\approx \frac{V}{N}
\\
\Rightarrow \ell &\approx \frac{1}{4\pi r^2}\frac{V}{N}
\end{align*}
$$

We can also estimate the average *time* between collisions:

$$
\overline{\varDelta t}=\frac{\ell}{\bar{v}}\approx \frac{\ell}{v_{rms}}
$$

Back to heat conduction. Consider a small region within a gas where the temperature increases in the $x$ direction. The net heat flow across the line is 

$$
Q=\frac{1}{2}(U_1-U_2)=-\frac{1}{2}(U_2-U_1)=-\frac{1}{2}C_V(T_2-T_1)=-\frac{1}{2}C_V\ell\frac{dT}{dx}
$$

Comparison to last equation yields an explicit prediction for the thermal conductivity:

$$
k_t=\frac{1}{2}\frac{C_V\ell}{A\Delta t}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{C_V}{V}\ell \bar{v}
$$

The quantity $C_V/V$is the heat capacity of the gas per unit volume, which can be evaluated as

$$
\frac{C_V}{V}=\frac{f}{2}\frac{P}{T}
$$

The preceding analysis of the thermal conductivities of gases is an example of what’s called **kinetic theory(动力学理论)**
